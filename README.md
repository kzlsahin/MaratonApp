The solution I have developed for a 3 hours codding sprint of "Bilge Adam Boost Star Developer" bootcamp.

## Task
Develop a console app which will calculate your running range according to user inputs of length of pace, rate of pace per minute and duration.
1. Enter pace length
2. Enter pace per minute
3. Enter duration of the run hour and minute
Note: please validate each entry

**Bonus:** can you improve the solution by considering the different phases of a run according to pace length and pace per minute
